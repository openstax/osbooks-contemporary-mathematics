  "detailedSolution": "Yes. The unit of value, cm<sup>2</sup>, is appropriate given the size of a sheet of paper. Because the total area of 2,412.89 cm<sup>2</sup> represents four sheets of paper, each sheet is approximately 600 cm<sup>2</sup>, which seems reasonable for a sheet of letter-size paper."
