  "taskDescription": "Jesse and Lila need to decide if they want to deposit money this year. If they do, they can deposit $17,400 and allow the money to grow for 35 years. However, they could wait 12 years before making the deposit. At that time, theyâ€™d be able to collect $31,700 but the money would only grow for 23 years. Their account earns 4.63% interest compounded monthly. Which plan will result in the most money, depositing $17,400 now or depositing $31,700 in 12 years?",
