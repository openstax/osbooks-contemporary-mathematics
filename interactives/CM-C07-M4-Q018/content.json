One of these games is called “Let ‘Em Roll.” In this game, players roll five 6-sided dice. These dice each have 3 faces labeled with a car; the other 3 faces are labeled with prize money amounts (one each of $500, $1,000, and $1,500). Players get to roll all 5 dice, and then have the opportunity to win additional rolls. If all 5 dice show a car, the contestant wins a new car. If not, the contestant can use any additional rolls to reroll the dice with prize money showing to try to win the car (or, they can take the total amount of money showing on the dice and end the game). Josh is playing this game, and he has 2 rolls total (these are the two stages of the experiment; the number of cars showing on the dice will be the reported outcome of each stage).",
