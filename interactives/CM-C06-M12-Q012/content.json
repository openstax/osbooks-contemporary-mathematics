  "questionSetStimulus": "For the following exercises, read the following: <b>Fifteen-year mortgage compared to 30-year mortgage.</b> A 15-year mortgage comes with advantages, the biggest being the home is paid off much sooner, and equity is built much more quickly. Mortgage interest rates are often higher for 30-year mortgages than 15-year mortgages. However, the payments for 15-year mortgages are considerably higher. The following exercises explore the difference between a 15- and 30-year mortgage for a mortgage of $200,000."
