  "taskDescription": "For a fundraiser at school, the Robotics Club is selling bags of apples and bunches of bananas during lunch. They will make a profit of $4 per bag of apples and $6 per bunch of bananas. Due to school health regulations, the club is allowed to have only 20 bags and bunches of fruit on school grounds each day to sell. Another regulation: the container where the Robotics Club keeps the fruit has a maximum weight capacity of 70 pounds. Each bag of apples weighs 3 pounds, while each bunch of bananas weighs 5 pounds. Determine the number of bags of apples and the number of bags of bananas the Robotics Club should sell each day to maximize their profit.",
