  "detailedSolution": "In a complete graph with three or more vertices, any three vertices form a triangle which is a cycle. Any edge in a graph that is part of a cycle cannot be a bridge so, there are no bridges in a complete graph. Also, any edge that is part of a triangle cannot be a local bridge because the removal of any edge of a triangle will leave a path of only two edges between the vertices of that edge. So, there are no bridges or local bridges in a complete graph."
