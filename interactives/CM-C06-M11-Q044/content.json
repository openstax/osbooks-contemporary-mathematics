  "taskDescription": "Mwibeleca needs to budget for his car maintenance. He expects to buy new tires each 3 years, which will cost her $560 to replace them all. Oil changes near his cost $69.99, and he believes he will get one every 4 months. His inspection costs $25 per year. Brake pads will cost $215 each year. Wipers for his car cost $143.50 for all three and he anticipates changing them every year. He drives less than 30,000 miles per year, so he plans to replace the air filter once per year. The air filter for his car costs $62.88. How much should Mwibeleca budget per month to cover these costs?",
