  "taskDescription": "Refer to the image of <i>Monopoly Junior</i> in Figure 12.61. In <i>Monopoly Junior</i> each player can move from one space to another by rolling one six-sided die. Suppose that you constructed a graph to represent the <i>Monopoly Junior</i> board such that each vertex represented a space on the game board and each edge represented the ability of a player to move between two spaces based on a roll of the dice. Identify three differences between a graph based on <i>Monopoly Junior</i> and a graph based on the original <i>Monopoly</i> board discussed in Example 14 which would show the graphs are not isomorphic.",
