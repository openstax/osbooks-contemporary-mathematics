  "taskDescription": "When the city of Cocoa annexed an adjacent unincorporated community, the number of seats on the city council was increased to maintain the standard ratio of citizens to seats, but one existing community of Cocoa still lost a seat on the city council to another existing community of Cocoa when the new community was added. Is this scenario an example of a quota rule violation, the Alabama paradox, the population paradox, the new-states paradox, or none of these?",
