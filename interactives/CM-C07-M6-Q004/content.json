  "questionSetStimulus": "The following exercises deal with our version of the game blackjack. In this card game, players are dealt a hand of two cards from a standard deck. The dealer’s cards are dealt with the second card face up, so the order matters; the other players’ hands are dealt entirely face down, so order doesn’t matter. The goal of the game is to build a hand whose point value is as close as possible to 21 without going over. The point values of each card are as follows: numbered cards are worth the number on the face (for example, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow>\n  <mn>8</mn>\n  <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">♣<!-- ♣ --></mi>\n</mrow><annotation encoding=\"LaTeX\">8\\clubsuit</annotation></semantics></math> is worth 8 points); jacks, queens, and kings are each worth 10 points, and aces are worth either 1 or 11 points (the player can choose). Players whose hands are worth less than 21 points may ask to be dealt additional cards one at a time until they either go over 21 points or they choose to stop."
