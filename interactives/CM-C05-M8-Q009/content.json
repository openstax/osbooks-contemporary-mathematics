Between 1995 and 2000, the slope is 4; on average the school gained 4 teachers every year. Then the slope is 0 between 2000 and 2005 meaning the number of teachers remained the same. There was a decrease in teachers between 2005 and 2010, represented by a slope of â€“2. Finally, the slope is 4 between 2010 and 2020, which indicates that on average the school gained 4 teachers every year."

Jones High School was founded in 1990 and hired 2 teachers per year until 1995, when they had an increase in students and they hired 4 teachers per year for the next 5 years. Then there was a hiring freeze, and no teachers were hired between 2000 and 2005. After the hiring freeze, the student population decreased, and they lost 2 teachers per year until 2010. Another surge in student population meant Jones High School hired 4 new teachers per year until 2020 when they had 80 teachers at the school. "
