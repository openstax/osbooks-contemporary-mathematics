The number of students at Chapel Run Elementary went up while the number of students at Panther Trail Elementary went down, but Chapel Run now has 1 fewer resources officers while Panther Trail has one more than it did previously. Is this scenario an example of a quota rule violation, the Alabama paradox, the population paradox, the new-states paradox, or none of these?",
