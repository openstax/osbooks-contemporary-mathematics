  "detailedSolution": "Elijah should budget $1,631.72 for needs, $979.03 for wants, and $652.69 for savings and debt service. When choosing where to live, what to eat, and what to drive, he should make choices that keep those costs, combined with debt service costs, gasoline, and utilities, below $1,631.72. This means he will have to make decisions about what his priorities are. Elijah should then figure out his wants, and stay within the limits here, that is, keep those costs below $979.03. Finally, he can begin to build his savings with the remaining $652.69."
