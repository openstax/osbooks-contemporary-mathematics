The horizontal and vertical axes range from negative 10 to 10, in increments of 1. The first line passes through the points, (negative 6, 9), (0, 3), (3, 0), and (8, negative 5). The second line passes through the points, (negative 10, negative 8), (0, negative 1.5), (2.5, 0), and (9, 4.4). The two lines intersect at (2.8, 0.4). The region within the lines and to the left of the intersection point is shaded in gray. The region within the lines and to the right of the intersection point is shaded in dark blue. The region within the lines and below the intersection point is shaded in light blue. Note: all values are approximate.\">",
