  "taskDescription": "In a particular poker tournament, five groups of five players will play at a table until one player wins, then the five winning players will play each other at a table in a final round. Explain how a graph or multigraph might be drawn to model this scenario by identifying the objects that could be represented by vertices and the connections that could be represented by edges. Indicate whether a graph or a multigraph would be a better model.",

  "detailedSolution": "The objects that are represented with vertices are poker players. An edge between a pair of vertices would indicate the two players competed against each other at table. This is best represented as a graph because players from the same table never meet a second time. Also, a player cannot compete against themself; so, there is no need for a loop."
