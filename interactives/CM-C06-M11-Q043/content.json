  "taskDescription": "Sara needs to budget for her car maintenance. She expects to buy new tires each 3 years, which will cost her $540 to replace them all. Oil changes near her cost $39.99, and she believes she will get one every 4 months. Her inspection costs $20 per year. Wipers for her car cost $115 for all three and she anticipates changing them every year. She drives less than 30,000 miles per year, so she plans to replace the air filter once per year. The air filter for her car costs $36.25. She plans to get new brake pads every year, which cost her $267. How much should she budget per month to cover these costs?",
