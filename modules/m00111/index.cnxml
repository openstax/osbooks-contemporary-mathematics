When the same regions are mapped on a spherical globe, the countries that are closer to the polls appear smaller without the distortion. Despite these differences, the two maps still communicate the same relationships between nations such as shared boundaries, and relative position on the earth. In essence, they are the same map. This means that for every point on one map, there is a corresponding point on the other map in the same relative location. In this section, we will determine exactly what characteristics need to be the shared by two graphs in order for us to consider them “the same”.</para>

    <para id="para-00010">Looking at Figure 12.51, how can we know that these graphs are isomorphic? We will start by checking for any obvious differences. Each of the graphs in Figure 12.51 has 4 vertices and 5 edges; so, there are differences there. Next, we will focus on the degrees of the vertices, which have been labeled in Figure 12.52.</para>

    <para id="para-00013">To know with certainty that these graphs are isomorphic, we need to confirm one of the two conditions from the definition of isomorphic graphs. With smaller graphs, you may be able to visualize how to stretch and twist one graph to get the other to see if condition 1 holds. Imagine the edges are stretchy and picture how to pull and twist one graph to form the other. If you can do this without breaking or adding any connections, then the graphs are really the same. Figure 12.54 demonstrates how to change graph A<sub>4</sub> to get A<sub>3</sub>, graphA<sub>3</sub> to get A<sub>2</sub>, and graph A<sub>2</sub> to get A<sub>1</sub>. Now that we have used visual analysis to see that condition 1 holds for graphs A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>4</sub> in Figure 12.47, we know that they are isomorphic.</para>

Graphs that can be untangled and called <term id="term-00001">planar</term> graphs. The complete graph with 5 vertices is an example of a <term id="term-00002">nonplanar</term> graph-that means that, no matter how hard you try, you can’t untangle it. But, when you try figure out if two graphs are the same, it can be helpful to untangle them as much as possible to make the similarities and differences more obvious.</para>

    <para id="para-00046">When two graphs are really the same graph, they have the same missing edges. So, when two graphs have a lot of edges, it may actually be easier to determine if they are isomorphic by looking at which edges are missing rather than which edges are included. In other words, we can determine if two graphs are isomorphic by checking if their complements are isomorphic.</para>
